# scale_vm_clone (Resource)

ScaleVM resource to create a VM from a template VM

## Example Usage

```terraform
locals {
  vm_meta_data_tmpl = "./assets/meta-data.ubuntu-22.04.yml.tftpl"
  vm_user_data_tmpl = "./assets/user-data.ubuntu-22.04.yml.tftpl"
  vm_name           = "my-ubuntu-vm"
}

resource "scale_vm_clone" "myvm" {
  group          = "vmgroup"
  name           = local.vm_name
  source_vm_name = "my-template-vm.img"
  description    = "some description"

  vcpu      = 4
  memory    = 4096 # MiB
  disk_size = 20   # GB
  nics = [
    { type = "virtio" },
    { type = "INTEL_E1000", vlan = 10 }
  ]

  power_state = "started"
  meta_data = templatefile(local.vm_meta_data_tmpl, {
    name = local.vm_name,
  })
  user_data = templatefile(local.vm_user_data_tmpl, {
    name                = local.vm_name,
    ssh_authorized_keys = "",
    ssh_import_id       = "",
  })
}

output "vm_list" {
  value = scale_vm_clone.myvm.vm_list
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `meta_data` (String) User meta data terraform template (.yml.tftpl)
- `name` (String) Name of this VM
- `nics` (Attributes List) NICs for this VM (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--nics))
- `source_vm_name` (String) Name of the template VM from which this VM will be created
- `user_data` (String) User data terraform template (.yml.tftpl)

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description of this VM
- `disk_size` (Number) Disk size in GB
- `group` (String) Group/tag to create this VM in
- `memory` (Number) Memory (RAM) size in MiB: If the cloned VM was already created and it's memory was modified, the cloned VM will be rebooted (either gracefully or forcefully)
- `power_state` (String) Initial power state on create: If not provided, it will default to `stop`. Available power states are: start, started, stop, shutdown, reboot, reset. Power state can be modified on the cloned VM even after the cloning process.
- `vcpu` (Number) Number of CPUs on this VM. If the cloned VM was already created and it's VCPU was modified, the cloned VM will be rebooted (either gracefully or forcefully)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) ScaleVM identifier
- `vm_list` (String) List of VM objects currently on Scale (JSON as string)

<a id="nestedatt--nics"></a>
### Nested Schema for `nics`

Required:

- `type` (String) NIC type

Optional:

- `vlan` (Number) Specific VLAN to use
